-The goal of this project is to test my html knowledge by building a basic recipe website

8/26/2022
-Created Main page with links to sub pages containing recipes along with images 
-Credited original creators of all recipes as listed on: 
www.allrecipes.com/

8/28/2022 
-created style.css file and linked to all html files 

Future ideas: 
-Study design to come up with interesting color template and design for main page and recipe pages
-Figure out ideal image sizing... 

-Would like to make main page more excited to view
-Maybe create some kind of item "card" for each recipe that can be clicked on
-If other recipes are added that are not breakfast related, I would like to create a "Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner" catagories on main page.
