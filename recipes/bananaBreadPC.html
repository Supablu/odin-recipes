        <h3>Delicious flavorful fluffy Banana Cake Pancakes</h3>
        <div>
            <p>If you're a fan of our banana bread, then you're gonna love this, since it's based on that recipe. As
                easy
                as
                that is to make, these are even easier. I really think that this threads the needle between something
                that
                has the flavor of banana bread, but that is very close to the texture of a classic pancake. Top with
                butter
                and banana slices and serve with warm maple syrup.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 ¼</strong> cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li><strong>½</strong> teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li><strong>½</strong> teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li><strong>¼</strong> teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> large ripe banana</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> large egg</li>
                <li><strong>⅓</strong> cup white sugar</li>
                <li><strong>¼</strong> cup milk</li>
                <li><strong>¼</strong> teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li><strong>¼</strong> cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li><strong>½</strong> cup finely chopped walnuts</li>
                <li>tablespoon unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl with a whisk. Reserve until
                    needed.
                </li>
                <li>Place banana in a mixing bowl and mash into a smooth paste with a potato masher. Add egg and sugar
                    and
                    whisk thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add
                    milk,
                    vanilla extract, 1/4 cup melted butter, walnuts, and flour mixture. Whisk until just combined.</li>
                <li>Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large, nonstick pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is
                    hot,
                    transfer in about 1/3 cup of the batter per pancake. Reduce heat to medium and cook until edges
                    start to
                    look dry and small air bubbles pop up through the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until
                    golden
                    brown, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
